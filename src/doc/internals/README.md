% Rust Compiler Internals

The Rust compiler is a complex project. Upon first inspection, it can be a
daunting task to attempt to understand all the various crates & modules, the
flow of data and the internal data structures.

This guide aims to give the reader a greater understanding of the inner
workings of the compiler along with some in-depth views into the individual
components of which it is composed.

**NOTE**: This guide assumes a working knowledge of Rust & compilers in
general.
