% Rust Documentation

Welcome to the Rust documentation! You can use the section headings above
to jump to any particular section.

# Getting Started

If you haven't seen Rust at all yet, the first thing you should read is the
introduction to [The Rust Programming Language](book/index.html). It'll give
you a good idea of what Rust is like.

The book provides a lengthy explanation of Rust, its syntax, and its
concepts. Upon completing the book, you'll be an intermediate Rust
developer, and will have a good grasp of the fundamental ideas behind
Rust.

# Language Reference

Rust does not have an exact specification yet, but an effort to describe as much of
the language in as much detail as possible is in [the reference](reference.html).

# Standard Library Reference

We have [API documentation for the entire standard
library](std/index.html). There's a list of crates on the left with more
specific sections, or you can use the search bar at the top to search for
something if you know its name.

# The Rustonomicon

[The Rustonomicon] is an entire book dedicated to explaining
how to write `unsafe` Rust code. It is for advanced Rust programmers.

# The Error Index

If you encounter an error while compiling your code you may be able to look it
up in the [Rust Compiler Error Index](error-index.html).
